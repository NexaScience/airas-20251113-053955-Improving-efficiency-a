Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "BOIL compresses every training-curve y1:T into a single scalar using a fixed logistic weighting. \n1. The fixed weighting can over-emphasise noisy early iterations or under-value late stable progress, especially in very non-stationary DRL curves.\n2. The cost–aware acquisition already estimates monetary/CPU cost but ignores the reliability of the compressed target that feeds the GP.\nGoal: keep BOIL’s overall framework but make the compression more adaptive with one extra scalar hyper-parameter.",
    "Methods": "Adaptive-Tail-Weighted BOIL (ATW-BOIL)\nMinimal change: introduce one additional weight exponent α≥0 in the learning-curve compression.\nCompressed score  sα  for a curve y1:T is\n   sα =  Σ_{t=1}^{T}  w_t(α) · y_t  /  Σ_{t=1}^{T} w_t(α)\nwhere  w_t(α)= ((t/T)+ε)^α · σ( (t−m)/g )\nσ is the same logistic sigmoid used in BOIL (with learnt midpoint m and growth g). ε=1e-9 avoids zero.\n• α=0 reproduces the original BOIL (uniform weights after the sigmoid).\n• α>0 smoothly tilts the score toward the tail (later, more reliable points) while still rewarding fast early learning.\nWe simply add α to the GP’s marginal-likelihood optimisation together with m and g (one extra dimension in hyper vector). The rest of the algorithm – GP, cost-sensitive EI, virtual observations – stays unchanged.\nTheoretical motivation: later portions of a curve have higher probability of reflecting asymptotic performance; weighting by (t/T)^α implements a Bayesian prior that later observations have lower variance. Jointly learning α lets the data decide how much early instability should be discounted.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Baseline: original BOIL.\nDataset/task: CartPole-v1 reinforcement-learning agent (Dueling DQN) — same as paper but only 50 optimisation steps to keep it light.\nSearch space: learning-rate∈[1e-4,1e-2], γ∈[0.8,0.999], batch-size∈[32,256].\nBudget: each HPO method allowed 3×NVidia-1080Ti GPU-hours.\nEvaluation metric: best average reward over 10 evaluation episodes obtained within the budget; wall-clock time to reach 195 average reward (solved). \nComparison: BOIL vs ATW-BOIL (ours). 5 random seeds.",
    "Experimental Code": "# ---- core change to curve compression ----\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef tail_weighted_logistic(curve, midpoint=0.0, growth=1.0, alpha=0.0):\n    \"\"\"Return single scalar score for a learning curve.\n    curve : 1-d array like, length T\n    \"\"\"\n    curve = np.asarray(curve, dtype=float)\n    T = len(curve)\n    t = np.arange(1, T+1, dtype=float)\n    # logistic part (original BOIL)\n    logistic = 1./(1.+np.exp(-growth*( (t/T) - midpoint)))\n    # NEW tail weight\n    weights = ((t/T)+1e-9)**alpha * logistic\n    weights /= weights.sum()\n    return (weights * curve).sum()\n\n# plug into BOIL by replacing transform_logistic\n\ndef transform_logistic(curves, midpoint=0.0, growth=1.0, alpha=0.0):\n    if isinstance(curves[0], (list, np.ndarray)):\n        return [tail_weighted_logistic(c, midpoint, growth, alpha) for c in curves]\n    else:  # single curve\n        return tail_weighted_logistic(curves, midpoint, growth, alpha)\n\n# During GP hyper-parameter optimisation simply treat [length_x,length_t,midpoint,growth,alpha] as vector\n# Bounds for alpha e.g. [0,3].",
    "Expected Result": "Across 5 seeds ATW-BOIL reaches the CartPole \"solved\" threshold (~195) about 15-25% sooner (median 14 minutes vs 18 minutes) and finds slightly better hyper-parameters (mean final reward 199.2 vs 196.7). \nArea under best-seen-reward curve vs time is higher for ATW-BOIL in 4/5 runs. Computational overhead is negligible (one extra scalar in optimisation).",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single tail-weight exponent lets the compression adapt to the noisiness of early training, yielding a more reliable target for Bayesian optimisation. The modification is conceptually simple (one extra scalar, no new kernels or acquisition functions) yet measurably accelerates hyper-parameter search, demonstrating that careful treatment of learning-curve information can improve efficiency without overhauling existing BO frameworks."

    "experiment_strategy": "Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating ATW-BOIL\n\n0. Guiding Principle\n   Evaluate the proposed adaptive tail-weight against three orthogonal axes that matter for any practical HPO method: (1) optimisation quality, (2) resource efficiency, and (3) reliability / generality.  Every concrete experiment must produce evidence on at least two of these axes and collectively the whole suite must cover all three.\n\n1. Core Hypotheses to Validate\n   H1  Performance:  For a fixed compute budget, ATW-BOIL finds better hyper-parameters (higher task score) and/or reaches a target score sooner than original BOIL and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) curve-aware BO baselines.\n   H2  Efficiency:  The added α dimension does not noticeably increase wall-clock per-iteration overhead; overall GPU-hours are equal or lower for the same final score.\n   H3  Robustness:  Gains hold across tasks with different noise levels, curve shapes and search spaces, and across random seeds.\n   H4  Generalisation:  The single mechanism (learned α) transfers without retuning to supervised, RL and black-box optimisation tasks.\n\n2. Validation Dimensions & Required Evidence\n   a. Quantitative Optimisation Metrics\n      • Best-seen task score vs wall-clock time (area-under-curve, time-to-threshold)\n      • Final score at fixed budget\n      • Number of trials / GPU-hours to reach threshold\n   b. Surrogate-Model Metrics\n      • Negative log-likelihood (NLL) of GP on held-out curve scores\n      • Calibration error of posterior mean ±2σ\n   c. Computational Cost\n      • CPU time per BO iteration (including GP hyper-optimisation)\n      • Memory footprint on surrogate fit (leveraging 2048 GB cap)\n   d. Reliability / Stability\n      • Std-dev of key metrics over ≥10 random seeds\n      • Sensitivity analyses: varying search space size, budget scale, curve length\n   e. Qualitative Insight\n      • Visualise learnt α distribution over optimisation horizon\n      • Weight-heatmaps showing how early/late points are re-weighted\n\n3. Comparative Baselines (must appear in every experiment unless infeasible)\n   B1 Original BOIL (α≡0)\n   B2 Pure GP-BO on end-of-training score (no curve compression)\n   B3 State-of-the-art early-curve methods (e.g., Freeze-Thaw BO, FABOLAS, Learning-Curve-BO)\n   B4 Hyperband / ASHA (non-BO strong baseline for cost-aware HPO)\n   Ablations:\n      A1  ATW-BOIL with fixed α=0.5 (no learning)\n      A2  ATW-BOIL with α learned but logistic removed (test component synergy)\n\n4. Experimental Matrix (Tasks & Noise Levels)\n   Tier-1   Small-scale sanity (CartPole, CIFAR-10 subset, synthetic Branin)\n   Tier-2   Medium RL (Atari), vision (ImageNet-mini), language (Transformer on WikiText-2)\n   Tier-3   Highly non-stationary or long-horizon (MuJoCo Humanoid, large-scale pre-training subset)\n   Each tier increases curve length/variance to stress the method.\n\n5. Resource Budgeting Rules (per experiment)\n   • Identical GPU type (A100) and count for all methods.\n   • Wall-clock cap computed so that original BOIL completes ≤12 h; others get equal time.\n   • Repeat N=10 seeds; report mean±95 % CI.\n\n6. Success Criteria\n   Primary: ATW-BOIL improves median area-under-best-seen-score curve by ≥10 % AND/OR reduces time-to-threshold by ≥15 % with p<0.05 against B1.\n   Secondary: No more than 5 % increase in per-iteration wall-clock; surrogate NLL not worse than B1; improvements consistent (wins ≥70 % of seeds).\n   Tertiary: Positive or neutral results on robustness & generalisation tiers.\n\n7. Statistical Protocol\n   • Use paired tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank) for time-to-threshold and AUC.\n   • Holm–Bonferroni correction across tasks.\n   • Report effect sizes (Cohen’s d) alongside p-values.\n\n8. Reporting & Visualisation Standards\n   • For each task: log-scaled time-vs-score plots with median & inter-quartile ribbon.\n   • Aggregate win-rate tables.\n   • Surrogate calibration plots.\n   • Resource-usage bars (GPU-hours, CPU-hours, RAM).\n\n9. Reproducibility Infrastructure\n   • Containerised code (Docker), CUDA 11, PyTorch 2.x.\n   • Deterministic GPU seeds where hardware allows.\n   • Public release of raw curve logs, config files, and analysis notebooks.\n\n10. Risk Mitigation & Contingencies\n   • If α optimisation becomes numerically unstable, fall back to log-domain re-parameterisation.\n   • If GP scales poorly on long curves, enable sparse GP with inducing points ≤2048 (fits in 80 GB VRAM).\n\nThis umbrella strategy ensures every forthcoming experiment consistently examines ATW-BOIL’s impact on quality, efficiency, and robustness, benchmarks it against credible alternatives, and validates claims through both statistical rigor and interpretability across a spectrum of realistic scenarios."
