# Paper Outline
BOIL employs a Bayesian optimization framework with a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model over the joint space of input hyperparameters and training iterations. It uses a cost-sensitive acquisition function (a modified Expected Improvement criterion, α(x,t)/µc(x,t)) to select the next point, balancing exploitation, exploration, and computational cost. Learning curves are compressed into a single numeric score using a Sigmoid (Logistic) preference function, whose growth and middle point parameters are learned by maximizing the GP's log marginal likelihood. To improve sample-efficiency and prevent ill-conditioning of the GP covariance matrix, a data augmentation technique selectively includes a subset of points from the training curve, chosen based on maximizing GP predictive uncertainty and controlled by a condition number threshold.
